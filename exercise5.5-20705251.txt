scipy

"""
#import required libraries
import scipy as sc
#define the function
def f(x):
    return x**4 - 19*(x**3) + 117*(x**2) - 261*x + 162


#the parameters of fsolve are: f, the function itself and x0, a starting
#estimate. With x0 = 5 it returns 6 and with x0 = 100 it returns 9
#Basically, it returns the root closest to x0

#range
n = 10

#for loop that generates different estimates
#was designed by having a good idea of what the function looks like and how
#often the roots occur
for i in range(0, n, 3):
    #print the closest root to that estimate
    print("The root is: ", sc.optimize.fsolve(f, i))
