# Computational Physics
Projects done in university in computational physics module. The instructions are detailed below:

Exercise 1.2 
Type in the program above (don’t worry yet about the details), save it as a Python file (text file with a .py extension), run it and check that it works. (The button with the green triangle runs the current Python file, or else you can type run filename.py in the IPython command line.) 

---

Exercise 1.3 
Write a Python program to:
add, subtract, multiply and divide the two complex numbers 2+3i and 3-7i,
subtract 2 from -3+4i
divide 7 by 2
(put comments in your code). 

---

Exercise 1.4 
Use a for-loop to go through the list L=[5,7,18,9,0,1,3,7,7,2] and find the largest item and its index, i.e. for this list you should print “the largest value is 18, item number 3 in the list”. 

---

Exercise 1.5 
Generate an array, called x, of 100 evenly spaced values between 0 and 2𝜋 inclusive (you can use np.pi for 𝜋). Generate an array, called y, whose elements are the sine of the x array (i.e. y[i] = sin(x[i]) etc.).

Exercise 1.7 
Type in and run the following code: 

---

Exercise 1.8 
Plot the function 𝑓(𝑥) = sin(𝑥) between 𝑥 = 0 and 𝑥 = 2𝜋 with a green dashed line. Label your axes, add gridlines and a legend. Your axes should extend only as far as the plotted data.

Exercise 1.9 
Type in and run the following code:

---

Problem P1.1
Write a program to plot the trajectory of a projectile thrown from the surface of the Earth.
The user should be allowed to specify the initial velocity, launch angle and time interval

---

Exercise 2.2 
Write a program to calculate the derivative of a function (defined in the program) at a point using the 3-point derivative.
Use it to calculate 

$$
\frac{d(\sin x)}{dx} \text{ at } x = \frac{\pi}{4} \, (\text{use } h = 0.01)
$$


What is the analytical answer?

---

Exercise 2.3
Write a program to calculate the derivative of a function (defined in the program) at a point using the 5-point derivative.
Use it to calculate 

$$
\frac{d(\sin x)}{dx} \text{ at } x = \frac{\pi}{4} \, (\text{use } h = 0.01)
$$

---

2.4 Write a program to plot both a function and its derivative (calculated using either the 3-or 5-point formula) over a specified range (you can use sin(𝑥) as an example and define therange in the program). 

---

Problem P2.1 Plot sin(𝑥) and 𝑑(sin(𝑥))/d𝑥 in the range [0,4𝜋].
Plot the error in the 3 point and 5 point derivative of sin(𝑥). (You can find the error because you know what the analytical answer is.)
Add some random noise to sin(𝑥) and repeat using the 3- and 5-point method.
Which method is more sensitive to noise?
