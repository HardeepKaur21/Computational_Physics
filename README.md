# Computational-Physics
Projects done in university in computational physics module. The instructions are detailed below:

Exercise 1.2 Type in the program above (don’t worry yet about the details), save it as a Python file (text file with a .py extension), run it and check that it works. (The button with the green triangle runs the current Python file, or else you can type run filename.py in the IPython command line.)

Exercise 1.3 Write a Python program to:
add, subtract, multiply and divide the two complex numbers 2+3i and 3-7i,
subtract 2 from -3+4i
divide 7 by 2
(put comments in your code).

Exercise 1.4 Use a for-loop to go through the list L=[5,7,18,9,0,1,3,7,7,2] and find the largest item and its index, i.e. for this list you should print “the largest value is 18, item number 3 in the list”. 

---

Exercise 1.5 generate an array, called x, of 100 evenly spaced values between 0 and 2𝜋 inclusive (you can use np.pi for 𝜋). Generate an array, called y, whose elements are the sine of the x array (i.e. y[i] = sin(x[i]) etc.).

Exercise 1.7 Type in and run the following code:

Exercise 1.8 Plot the function 𝑓(𝑥) = sin(𝑥) between 𝑥 = 0 and 𝑥 = 2𝜋 with a green dashed line. Label your axes, add gridlines and a legend. Your axes should extend only as far as the plotted data.
